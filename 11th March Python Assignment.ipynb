The probability of making a Type I error is denoted by α and is typically set at 0.05 (i.e., 5%) or lower. __Example Scenario:__ A drug company is testing a new drug to treat a certain medical condition. They conduct a clinical trial in which they randomly assign patients to either receive the new drug or a placebo. After analyzing the data, the company concludes that the new drug is significantly more effective than the placebo. However, it turns out that this conclusion was based on a Type I error, and the drug is actually no more effective than the placebo.\n",

After analyzing the data, the district concludes that there is no significant difference in student performance between the schools that received the program and those that did not.
